          <h2><u>Shock Wave Boundary Layer Interactions</u></h2>
          <br>
          Laminar hypersonic flows at Mach 7.10 with unit Reynolds numbers of 
          5:2  104; 1:04  105, and 4:14  105 m1 over a 30/55 double-wedge
          configuration were studied to investigate the spatial–temporal characteristics
           of the flow in a time-accurate manner. Close comparisons were made
          between previous kinetic and current continuum approaches to test the validity 
          of the continuum assumption, especially considering the presence of
          large gradients associated with shock–shock and shock–boundary layer interactions,
           as well as spanwise instabilities. Previous results from direct
          simulation Monte Carlo, which inherently predicts rarefied effects such as velocity 
          slip and temperature jumps, were found to be in very close
          agreement with the current work, even for the lowest Reynolds number. 
          The impact of velocity slip and temperature jumps on flow and surface
          parameters was investigated, and comparisons were made with a no-slip and constant
           temperature wall model. The temporal and spatial variation
          of two- and three-dimensional flows were thoroughly investigated using two-dimensional
           (2D), three-dimensional (3D) periodic sidewall boundary
          conditions, and a full 3D configuration consistent with existing experimental data. 
          Close comparisons among the 2D and 3D cases were made. The
          characteristics of 2D periodic oscillations were reported for the moderate Reynolds 
          number case for the first time. The presence of spanwise instabilities, even at a relatively 
          low free stream pressure of about 100 Pa,
           establishes that the flow field depends on spanwise effects and is fully 3D.
          High-fidelity numerical schlieren videos captured strong spanwise oscillations for 3D configurations.
